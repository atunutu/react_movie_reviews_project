React Movie Critic Review Project

The following features should are within the site:

A reviews list should be displayed by publication date with the most recent first and only display the image, title, date of publication, MPAA Rating and Critics pick. We'd like the amount of reviews displayed to be variable with a default of 20 upon loading the page. The user may increase this but no more than 50 at a time.
Users should be able to search by title and filter by:
MPAA Rating
Publication date
Critic's pick
The search functionality should apply the filter as the user types
Clicking a review should display: 
Title
image
MPAA Rating
if it's a critic's pic
headline 
summary of the review 
the critic's name (re: byline) 
link to the article
Users search and/or filters should not be lost after viewing a review
A critics page with the number of reviews each critic has written and how many are critics pick. Please display the critic's image and bio if they are available in the list.
